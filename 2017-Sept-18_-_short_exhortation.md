# Short exhortaion from I Peter 1:23-25 [ESV]

```
[23] since you have been born again, not of perishable seed but of imperishable, through the living and abiding word of God;  
[24] for
All flesh is like grass
and all its glory like the flower of grass.
The grass withers,
and the flower falls,
[25] but the word of the Lord remains forever.
And this word is the good news that was preached to you. 
```

## Notes

+ Peter cites Isaiah 40:6, 8 to contrast the weakness of human flesh with The Power of The WORD OF THE LORD that has granted new life to believers.
	- This word of God is "living and abiding" (verse 23), in Heb 4:12 says "living and active". God's word is **ALIVE** brethren! This life of the Word is no less than the life of God Himself, for as God is, so must His Word be. 
	- It is through This word that we are brought to life (c.f Eph 2: dead in trespasses & sins).
	- Rom 10:17 -- faith comes from hearing, and hearing through the word of Christ. 

 + God's word brought us to new life in Christ, and it is this same Word that will keep us and sustain us, even in times of trouble, or sorrow.
 	- Thus, we ought to cling to His eternal word.
 	- all else is vanity. Notice (In verse 24) how transitory humanity is: here today, gone tomorrow. People pass away like plants under the hot breath of the withering east wind.

 + "the word of the Lord will stand forever." -- The permanence of God's word guarantees against any deviation from the **DIVINE PLAN**. This life is also power or energy, power harnessed for work. God says in Isaiah 55:11 -- "so shall my word be that goes out from my mouth; it shall not return to me empty, but it shall accomplish that which I purpose, and shall succeed in the thing for which I sent it."
 	- Again, in Jeremiah 29:11 -- "For I know the plans I have for you, declares the LORD, plans for wholeness and not for evil, to give you a future and a hope."
 	- Thus, even when things seem not to go our way, or when trials and storms come our way, The WORD of THE LORD and All of God's promises contained herein still stand, and we do well to trust in His precious, glorious WORD, which abides forever.
 	- Because the Word of God “liveth and abideth forever” (1 Peter 1:23), its vitality and potency remain both unexhausted and undiminished through time. Believers discover with Martin Luther that “the Bible is alive, it speaks to me; it has feet, it runs after me; it has hands, it lays hold on me. The Bible is not antique, or modern. It is eternal.

+ We can therefore draw comfort from God's word. In Psalms 119:50 we read “This is my comfort in my affliction, that your promise gives me life”.
	- God's Word, the author tells us, has been the source of his comfort in his affliction. In fact, he says that God’s promises give him life.
	- We see here a strong affirmation of the power and efficacy of God’s Word. By means of His Word, the Lord brings life to His people—first in conversion, when the Holy Spirit makes the “word of truth” real to us and enables us to trust in His revelation (James 1:18), and then throughout the Christian life as we who are regenerate continue to receive His promises in faith (v. 21). 
+ God’s Word assures us that if we are faithful to Him, He will bless us (Deut. 28:1–14), but it also gives us the good news that though we are incapable of being perfectly faithful to Him, He is faithful to us. 
+ He has given us Christ, in whom all blessings are guaranteed for those who rest in Him alone. If we are weary and heavy laden, we can go to Him and find rest for our souls, as His yoke is easy and His burden light (Matt. 11:28–30). He is the One in whom we find strength to do all things (Phil. 4:13).
+ We find Christ in the heavenly places, where we may enter boldly, if we are in Him (Heb. 10:19–22). There He speaks to us, not through esoteric visions but through His Word. In His Word, He gives us what we need to find sustenance, even in the day of adversity.
+ Brethren, times like these, it is critical for us to remember that the God who is sovereign and mighty is also **Immanuel** — God with us.
    - When our grief is debilitating and it feels impossible to function, God does not sit aloof in heaven. 
        * He does not leave us to figure out how to handle grief on our own or how to cast about for resources to get through it. 
        * He walks every step of the journey with us.
    - Jesus came and lived as a human in this broken world. He understands what we go through. 
        * He knows the tormenting thirst and weakness of life's final hours.
        * As our High Priest who fully understands our heartaches, He intercedes for us (Heb. 7:25), as does His Holy Spirit (Rom. 8:26). 
        * He calls us friends (John 15:15) and 
        * promises that He will never leave nor forsake us (Heb. 13:5), 
        * that His Spirit will dwell in us (John 14), 
        * and that He will give us peace (14:27; 16:33) and even joy (15:11; 16:22).
    - What we need most in the midst of grief is God Himself. 
        * He will meet us, 
        * give us Himself, 
        * fill the void left by our loved ones, 
        * warm our hearts, 
        * lift our burdens, 
        * and draw us into the sweet balm of fellowship with His Spirit. 
        * And as our Father tenderly swaddles us in His love, 
            1. our love for Him will grow, 
            2. our faith and trust will deepen, 
            3. and even amid the heartache of grief we will praise Him with deep and true joy.
    - This is something the Lord does by His Spirit; through His **Word**, **prayer**, and the **fellowship and love of His people**.
        * These means of grace are not “tasks” for our to-do list — more burdens placed on our grief-weary shoulders. 
        * They are His love for us. 
        * If in your grief you struggle to pray or read the Bible, ask someone to pray for you and read the Bible to you..

## Conclusion

> If we meditate carefully on [God’s] word, we shall live even in the midst of death, nor will we meet with any sorrow so heavy for which it will not furnish us with a remedy.
